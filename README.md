CONTRIBUTOR NEEDED!!!!
=============================================
Tired of watching Netflix and reading Hacker news? I got some tasks for you! Some brand new projects, recently moved from previous projects battle-tested internal tools to open source. We are revising them as standalone open source tools. 

Some limited sponsorship may be available. Hurry!


About the project: 
-------------------
We are implementing a new architecture for plugin management, inspired by my nightmares (!), which will make life easy for devs (dividing your big project into small packages, max reusability, tracking plugin activities, security, etc.) 

The documentation site (pinglue.org) is [under construction](https://github.com/pinglue/site)(contrbution is welcome!) You can access the raw docs (mdx format) directly from these repos:

https://github.com/pinglue/pg-repo
https://github.com/pinglue/doc-pgweb

Until then ...
